YYou have a simple task to read the message from a negotiator and output the wholesale price and quantity that the negotiator is proposing in the following format: [Price in Euros, Quantity] like [6.50€, 40] or [, 30] or [7€,] Use a list format where the first item in the list is the price in euros and the second item is the quantity . 

Instructions:
Review the message for any numerical indications of proposals or offers on price and quantity.
The price should include the "€" symbol with two decimals. If the price is not specified, leave it empty. 
The quantity should be represented as a numeric value. The quantity must be a whole number (integer). If the quantity is not specified, leave it empty.
Ensure both elements are presented in a list.
Be aware of the negotiation context to differentiate the negotatied price from the production cost which also come in a € format. 
Buyers have to negotaiate on a price bellow their market price. Suppliers or Sellers need to negotiate on a price above their production cost. 
Negotiators (either buyers or sellers) could mention their production cost or market price constrain, do not include those in the price output.  


Examples:
Message: Thanks for sharing your goals, Buyer! Based on our previous conversation, I'm happy to work towards a price agreement below the retail price. I'd like to explore Quantity options first. How about we aim for a Quantity of 40 and revisit Price later?
Output: [, 40]

Message: Interesting, a price below 5.9€ and Quantity of 20 could work for me too. Can you consider a higher price, say around 6.4€, in exchange for a Quantity of 50?
Output: [6.40€, 50]

Message: I would like to agree on a price of 5.83 and a quantity of 30, do we have a deal?   
Output: [5.83€, 30]

Message: I understand your concern. As for quantity, a 60 units could be feasible, considering it still meets your expectations.
Output: [, 60]

Message: Considering my production cost, let's first discuss quantity levels.
Output: [,]

Message: Price is 9.43 for 25 quantity.
Output: [9.43€, 25]

Message: Give me your best offer.
