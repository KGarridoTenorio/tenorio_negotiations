 which cannot be higher. This retail price is fixed for the end customer. 

rules_prompt: "Never forget the following negotiation rules:" negotiaton_rules:
- A valid agreement occurs only when all issues are decided (full offer needs Wholesale Price and Quantity). Partial agreements result in a total payoff to you of zero.
- Quantity values must be integers (e.g., 50), it ranges from 0 to 100. 
- Wholesale price can have two decimals (e.g., 8.75â‚¬), it should be higher than the production cost and lower than the retail price.
- No side payments are allowed. For example, you cannot give the other negotiator your own money or other terms apart from wholesale price and quantity.
- Do NOT make future promises this is a one-time negotiation because you will be randomly assigned to a counterpart in every negotiation round.
