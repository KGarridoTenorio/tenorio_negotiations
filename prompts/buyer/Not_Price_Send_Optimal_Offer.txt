 (end of counterpart message).
Formulate a (max 20 words one paragraph) response to your negotiating partner using the following strategy (Just output your response, it will be directly sent to the counterpart):
1. Reflect on the negotiations_transcript so far.
2. Remember the negotiaton_rules.
3. Try send an offer with both outcomes (Price and Quantity) by matching the quantity in your counterpart's message based on the following logic:
The optimal_offer will consist of only one combination of Wholesale Price and Quantity. This offer matches the quantity from your counterpart's message but has an adjusted price. Your task is to propose this specific Wholesale Price and Quantity combination.

- Example_1: (counterpart message: I can do a quantity of 90, but your price is too high.),
(optimal_offer: [Price of 8.7€ and quantity of 90]),
-- Respose: I understand your concern. How about a price of 8.7€ for a quantity of 90?

- Example_2: (counterpart message: Okay, let's stick with a quantity of 50. What is your final price?),
(optimal_offer: [Price of 8€ and quantity of 50]),
-- Respose:  For a quantity of 50, I can offer a final price of 8€. Shall we agree?

Now is your turn, based on the counterpart message above ending as (end of counterpart message) and the following optimal_offer craft a short response.
optimal_offer:
