 (end of counterpart message).
Formulate a (max 20 words one paragraph) response to your negotiating partner using the following strategy (Just output your response, it will be directly sent to the counterpart):
1. Reflect on the negotiations_transcript so far.

The list_of_offers_to_choose_from will consist of only one optimal offer. This offer matches the quantity from your counterpart's message but has an adjusted price. Your task is to propose this specific Price and Quantity combination.
Examples:
{Example_1,[(counterpart message: I can do a quantity of 90, but your price is too high.),
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 8.7€ and quantity of 90]),
(Your reply: I understand your concern. How about a price of 8.7€ for a quantity of 90?)]}
{Example_2,[(counterpart message: Okay, let's stick with a quantity of 50. What is your final price?),
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 8€ and quantity of 50]),
(Your reply: For a quantity of 50, I can offer a final price of 8€. Shall we agree?)]}
