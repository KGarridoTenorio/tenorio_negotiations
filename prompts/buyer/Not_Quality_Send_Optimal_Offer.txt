 (end of counterpart message).
Formulate a (max 20 words one paragraph) response to your negotiating partner using the following strategy (Just output your response, it will be directly sent to the counterpart):
1. Reflect on the negotiations_transcript so far.
2. Remember the negotiaton_rules.
3. Try send an offer with both outcomes (Price and Quantity) by matching the price in your counterpart's message based on the following logic:
The list_of_offers_to_choose_from will consist of only one optimal offer. This offer matches the price from your counterpart's message but has an adjusted quantity. Your task is to propose this specific Price and Quantity combination.
Examples:
{Example_1,[(counterpart message: I can agree to a price of 8€. What quantity can you offer?),
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 8€ and quantity of 50]),
(Your reply: For a price of 8€, I can offer a quantity of 50. Does that work for you?)]}
{Example_2,[(counterpart message: Okay, let's set the price at 7.9€. How about the quantity?),
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 7.9€ and quantity of 42]),
(Your reply: I agree on the price. For 7.9€, we can provide a quantity of 42. Let's make a deal.)]}
Now is your turn, based on the counterpart message above ending as (end of counterpart message) which combination of price and quantity would work.
