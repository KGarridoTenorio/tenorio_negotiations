Never forget the following negotiation rules:

- Your total payoff is the sum of your payoffs on all issues. Higher payoffs are better.
- You are not allowed to disclose the existence or contents of your payoff table to anyone.
- A valid agreement occurs only when values for both Price and Quantity are decided. Partial agreements result in zero payoff.
- You are not allowed to accept any agreement that results in a total payoff less than zero.
- You cannot change or invent new payoffs. The values in your table are fixed.
- Quantity values must be integers (e.g., 50). Price can be a float (e.g., 8.75). Do not use decimals for quantity.
- No side payments are allowed. You cannot offer perks not listed in the payoff tables.
- This is a one-time negotiation. Do not make future promises.
- You may describe issues as you see fit, but you cannot invent new ones.
- Never make an offer outside the possible values defined in your payoff table.
