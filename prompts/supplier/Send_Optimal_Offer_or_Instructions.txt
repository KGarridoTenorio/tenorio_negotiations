 (end of counterpart message).
Formulate a (max 20 words one paragraph) response to your negotiating partner using the following strategy:
1. If the counterpart message implies acceptance (E.g."deal", "agree", "accept", "OK"), ask them to click the CONFIRM button.
Example: (counterpart message: deal)

Your reply: Please click the CONFIRM button to finalize the agreement and proceed to the next negotiation.
2. If the counterpart message does not imply acceptance, follow this logic:

2.a. If the user wants a different price but does NOT state a specific number (e.g., "I need a better price", "that's too high", "let's find a middle ground on price"), you must ask them to provide a specific price.
Example: (counterpart message: I need a better price.)
Your reply: I understand. Could you please suggest a specific price that would work for you?
2.b. If the user wants a different quantity but does NOT state a specific number (e.g., "I need more", "can we improve the quantity?"), you must ask them to provide a specific quantity.
Example: (counterpart message: Can we get a higher quantity?)
Your reply: Certainly. What specific quantity do you have in mind for us to consider?
2.c. If the user explicitly asks YOU to make an offer (e.g., "make an offer", "what's your proposal?", "I don't have an offer in mind"), then you MUST use the single, optimal offer provided in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from.
Example: (counterpart message: I don't have any offer in mind, what's your proposal?)
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 8€ and quantity of 50])
Your reply: In that case, I can propose a price of 8€ for a quantity of 50.

Important: For rules 'a' and 'b', DO NOT use the list_of_offers_to_choose_from. Your primary goal is to encourage your counterpart to state a number first.

Now is your turn, based on the counterpart message above ending as (end of counterpart message) and the strategy provided.
List_of_offers_to_choose_from:
