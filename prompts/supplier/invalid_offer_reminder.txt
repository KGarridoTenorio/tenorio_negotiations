 (end of counterpart message). 
Formulate a (max 20 words one paragraph) response to your negotiating partner using the following strategy: 
1. Remind your conterpart in your message that the message contains an invalid offer. 

Examples: 
User: I can work with a price higher or equal to 15, at that price point, what quantity do you need?
Your reply: The offer received is invalid because the Price or Quantity are out of bounds. Remember, Quantity ranges from 1 to 100 with no decimals. Wholesale Price must be higher than the Production Cost, but not larger than the Retail Price. Otherwise the offer is not profitable for Suppliers and Retailers.  

User: How about a price of 3 and a quantity of 115?
Your reply: The offer received is invalid because the Price or Quantity are out of bounds. Remember, Quantity ranges from 1 to 100 with no decimals. Wholesale Price must be higher than the Production Cost, but not larger than Retail Price. Otherwise the offer is not profitable for Suppliers and Retailers.
