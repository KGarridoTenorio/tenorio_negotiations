          <h5>Overview:</h5>
          <p>In this exercise, you will take the role of an employee at a Retailing or Supplying company.</p>

              <li>Both companies employ AI Agents and humans to negotiate over bags of pellets.</li>
              <li>The item is produced by the supplying company at a Production Cost (PC) of 3, 4, or 5.</li>
              <li>This item is sold by the retailer company at a Retail Price (RP) of 11.</li>
              <li>The Retailer and Supplier negotiate via chat on Wholesale Price (w) & Quantity (q).</li>
              <li>PC & RP are common knowledge and are drawn with equal probability in each round.</li>
              <li>After the negotiation, Demand (D) will be randomly drawn [0, 100] (Equal Probability)</li>
              <li>Supplier carries the risk of unsold inventory (any q > Demand will expire).</li>

          <li>Wholesale Price (w) Denoted in euros (€) with two decimals.</li>
